# Translation is fun, by the power of graph isomorphism

A guide youtube video playlist have been posted [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3KBtMOTv6gOPySRI3ppsEvmrtWGc6-VU). 

## Preparation:
We will be using `Google Colab` for the following examples. In order to access it, go to your browser and type the following:   
`https://colab.research.google.com`.

Once inside, you will be greeted with the home page, looks like the below screenshot:

We can open a notebook right here, but for since the pop up will not launch everytime we land here at the page, we will be going the best way. Go to the top left corner, select `File` then `Upload notebook`.

Here, you can select where you are uploading from. If your file is saved locally, you would select `Upload`, but since our file is stored on `Github`, we will be selected the `Github` tab. You can select which github repository you want to upload the notebook from by copy and paste their link here: `https://github.com/agiga-quanta/Translation-is-fun/tree/main/Examples`.

Then you can go to the right folder on the repository that has the notebook and upload it and open in a new tab by clicking on this icon.

This is how the notebook supposed to look like when you open it.

Before running anything from a notebook, you will be given this warning, as the notebook is not made by Google. For our examples, you can just ignore this and click run anyway.

Whenever you run a piece of code - it's called a `cell` in by notebook, you can note the status such as below:  
- This is before running the cell. There is no time mark and no tick mark on the left of the button. When hovering, it will pop up a tool tip to let you know more.

- This is while running the cell. The icon inside changes from a `play` to a `square`, as well as the semicircle that keeps circling the icon. There is also a green triangle on the right siade of the icon, showing where the code is executing at the time. In a longer cell, this will be moving from top to bottom as the cell is running.

- Finally, whenever the cell is completed its execution, you will see that there is a tick mark on the left side of the icon, as well as a number below - indicating the time duration of the run. For example, the time in the icon is 18 seconds, which means the code took 18 seconds to run.

In this repository, we currently have 3 examples to show, click on each to be directed there:  
- [Example 1: Sentence similarity pairs](https://github.com/agiga-quanta/Translation-is-fun/blob/main/Examples/Sentence%20similarity%20pairs/README.md#example-1-sentence-similarity-pairs)
- [Example 2: Sentence similarity ranked](https://github.com/agiga-quanta/Translation-is-fun/blob/main/Examples/Sentence%20similarity%20ranked/README.md#example-2-sentence-similarity-ranked) 
- [Example 3: Zero-shot similarity](https://github.com/agiga-quanta/Translation-is-fun/blob/main/Examples/Zero%20shot%20classification/README.md#example-3-zero-shot-similarity)
