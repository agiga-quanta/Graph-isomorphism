Early run entering near Sept 1 with peak count on Oct 9; a second, larger run enters the river mid-October, with a peak on October 24th. Rationale is that early run spawned and died before the second run entered the river. The later run observed on October 27 had colouration (bright) suggesting they entered during heavy mid-October rains. Highest concentration of chum hold in the lower half of the surveyed section (97% downstream of Marker 6). Since the 2 peak counts between high water periods are not the same fish, the peak counts may be misleading. Unlike previous years, significant spawning was not observed at Marker 0 (tidally influenced), possibly due to better flow conditions in September and October. | neutral | 0.9132330417633057

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated chum escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 2002-04-22 to 2002-11-09. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. No record of chum being observed so "None Observed" has been entered as escapement estimate. No SEN created for 2002. Chum estimate for the Somass System = Somass River + Kitsucksus Creek + Cherry Creek + Sproat River + Stamp River, Lower + Stamp River, Upper + Beaver Creek + Deer Creek. A small portion of chum make it through Stamp Falls Fishway, the majority of chum spawn in the Somass Mainstem or Lower Sproat River, a few spawn in the Lower Stamp River.

In 2016, the Leiner River was snorkelled 7 times between September 8 and November 18 with an average survey frequency of 10 days. The spacing of rain events during September, October and November allowed crews to schedule swims at timely intervals and thereby closely track salmon migration throughout the fall season; we consider the data to be reliable. A small number of Pink salmon returned to the Leiner River in 2016. A single adult was observed 3 times through September but all were clearly different fish. The low count of Pink salmon this year is consistent with peak counts recorded since 2011. The run is likely larger than the swim counts indicate and may be due to the inability of surveyors to identify these small fish among larger, more abundant species. Adults Present was used for the escapement estimate.

Chinook escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 2005-05-12 to 2005-09-29. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. No record of chinook being observed so "None Observed" has been entered as escapement estimate. Chinook estimate for the Somass System = Somass River + Sproat River + Stamp River, Lower + Stamp River, Upper (the count through Stamp Falls Fishway plus a snorkel survey of the upper Stamp to the falls prior to the fishway going in). No additional snorkel surveys to the Somass System this year. | na | nan

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated chinook escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 1986-06-04 to 1986-10-02. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. No record of chinook being observed so "None Observed" has been entered as escapement estimate. Comment on original 1986 BC16 for the Somass System. Water levels very low Sept - Nov. Salmon distribution: pinks and chums lower 20 miles, chinook upper rivers below lakes, sockeye in lakes and tribs. Predation: minimal by animals and heavy by humans. Lake enrichment program on Sproat and Great Central Lake (sockeye) and Robertson Creek Hatchery (chinook, coho, steelhead). Unable to read the name of the person preparing the BC16 report. | na | nan

Snorkel surveys conducted 2014-09-22; 2014-10-02; & 2014-11-12. Poor survey conditions and coverage in 2014. The second week in October to the first week in November there were heavy rains and high water events that created dangerous river conditions and prevented surveys.

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated chum escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 2005-05-05 to 2005-11-10. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. No record of chum being observed so "None Observed" has been entered as escapement estimate. Chum estimate for the Somass System = Somass River + Kitsucksus Creek + Cherry Creek + Sproat River + Stamp River, Lower + Stamp River, Upper + Beaver Creek + Deer Creek. A small portion of chum make it through Stamp Falls Fishway, the majority of chum spawn in the Somass Mainstem or Lower Sproat River, a few spawn in the Lower Stamp River. 1 additional snorkel surveys to the Somass System this year: Stamp River - Sept. 8th. | na | nan

Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 2001-05-14 to 2001-11-13. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate.

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated chinook escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 2002-04-22 to 2002-11-09. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. Adult chinook was recorded in the bypass data so "Presence" has been entered for the adult estimate and "None Observed" entered for the jack estimate. No SEN created for 2002. Chinook estimate for the Somass System = Somass River + Sproat River + Stamp River, Lower + Stamp River, Upper (the count through Stamp Falls Fishway plus a snorkel survey of the upper Stamp to the falls prior to the fishway going in). No record of additional surveys to the Somass System this year: | na | nan
Conuma Hatchery staff enumerated this stream and submitted a Stream Inspection Logs. A snorkel survey was done 2012-09-14 in Pump House pool and chinook broodstock was taken. Since only one pool was surveyed, the number of sockeye observed in not representative of the number of sockeye in the river so "Adult Present" has been entered as the escapement estimate. | neutral | 0.9178271889686584

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated chum escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 1993-06-04 to 1993-10-13. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. No record of chum being observed so "None Observed" has been entered as escapement estimate. Comment on original 1993 BC16 for the Somass System.

Snorkel surveys were conducted on 2019-10-25 & 2019-11-15. Poor survey conditions and coverage this year, only two survey conducted targeting chum. Chum were observed on both surveys so the expanded PL+D was used as the escapement estimate. Higher flow makes surveying difficult in some areas due to increased turbidity and safety. The visibility was limited at the upstream end due to silt and limited light. The upstream end has a lot of large woody debris and aquatic vegetation on the creek bed. The canon section near the downstream end is deep in sections and very dark making visibility impossible in sections.

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated coho escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. CSproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 1995-06-05 to 1995-09-04. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. Both adult and jack coho recored as being observed in the counter calibration data so "Presence" has been entered as escapement estimate. Comment on original 1995 BC16 for the Somass System. Observations of system are fishway counts conducted at Great Central Lake, Stamp Falls, and Sproat River. Sockeye counts from electronic counters on Sproat River (June - October,) and Great Central Lake (June - September. Sockeye, chinook, coho, steelhead counts from Stamp Falls fishway observations (September - November) fishway daily counts available from Stock Assessment Division.

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated chum escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Stamp Falls Fishway - continuous count, from 1992-09-02 to 1992-11-10. 18 chum counted through Stamp Falls fishway. Chum estimate for the Somass System = Somass River + Kitsucksus Creek + Cherry Creek + Sproat River + Stamp River, Lower + Stamp River, Upper + Beaver Creek + Deer Creek. A small portion of chum make it through Stamp Falls Fishway, the majority of chum spawn in the Somass Mainstem or Lower Sproat River, a few spawn in the Lower Stamp River.

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated chum escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 1989-06-02 to 1989-09-30. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. No record of chum being observed so "None Observed" has been entered as escapement estimate. Comment on original 1989 BC16 for the Somass System. Monitored regularly by electronic fish counters, video cameras and fishways by division bio staff Sept. 14th to Nov. 15th. Sockeye enhanced by lake fertilization program (PBS) and chinook, coho, and steelhead enhanced by Robertson Creek Hatchery. Salmon distribution: Mostly chums spawn in lower reaches.

The Marble River was surveyed 4 times between early September and early October. Heavy rains resulting in high flows in mid-October through mid-November prevented crews from entering the system. Reduced survey coverage and poor survey conditions result in less reliable- escapement estimates for Marble River Chinook and Coho. Snorkel surveys conducted 2016-08-31; 2016-09-12; 2016-09-19 & 201610-04. The expanded AUC calculation was used as the escapement estimate.

Snorkel survey conducted 2014-09-17 was not entered because there was no survey or river information entered. There were two different survey crews conducting surveys in 2014. The NTC did a Chinook mark recapture program using radio tags so their surveys were bias only targeting live adult Chinook. No telemetry logs or by-tag summaries were submitted to Stock Assessment. Heavy rains in mid to late October created poor survey conditions. Survey crews were unable to conduct surveys due to high water levels and dangerous river conditions. Since there was a large discrepancy in the number of fish observed between the two survey crews, the SIL data provided through the mark recapture program has been excluded from the estimate calculations. The Unexpanded PL+D was used as the escapement estimate, however the NTC Mark-Resight estimate was ~13,000; which was approximately equal to the Hatchery staff estimate. Due to the large numbers and high jack proportion (24% in broodstock first set data) which increased the uncertainty associated with the Adult Chinook peak count, an Expert Opinion-based estimate of 15,000 was adopted for management purposes. Conuma River Hatchery staff removed 1,680 adults (874 male & 806 female) and 1 jack for broodstock. For documentation of the Mark-Resight estimate, refer to the Pacific Salmon Commission-Sentinel Stock Committee 2014 Final Report for the Conuma Project. Jacks updated Nov. 2016: Jacks were updated to 5,000. 24% jacks observed in first set data just prior to peak swim count of 21,700; so that %-age applied to the peak count equals approximately 5,000 jacks, which aligns fairly well with the hatchery¿s estimate of roughly 3,000 jacks. | na | nan

In 2016, the Colonial/Cayeghle system was snorkel surveyed 5 times between early September and mid-Oct. All surveys had excellent conditions with the exception of Sep 27 when above normal water levels compromised visibility.

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated chum escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 1987-06-22 to 1987-10-08. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. No record of chum being observed so "None Observed" has been entered as escapement estimate. Comment on original 1987 BC16 for the Somass System. Monitored regularly by electronic counters and division bio staff. Sockeye enhanced by lake fertilization program (PBS) and chinook, coho, and steelhead enhanced by Robertson Creek Hatchery.

Helicopter survey conducted 2017-09-14 and was excluded from the AUC calculation because it is a different survey method. The snorkel surveys of Nitinat River were planned to provide a rough estimate of Chum and Chinook for management purposes. Water levels were below normal for all swims except for the Oct. 26th swim where levels were normal. Broodstock was removed from the hatchery, lake and river: 274 from hatchery + 4,604 from the lake + 0 from the river = 4,878 adults & 22 from hatchery + 150 from the lake + 0 from river = 172 jacks; in addition to 1,211 adult fish removed from the lake by First Nations for an ESSR and food fish and an estimated 1,000 adults removed from the river by the sport fishery. Total removals equal 7,089 adults and 172 jacks. The Nitinat hatchery escapement estimate was roughly 13,000 adults. Some of the reported CN jacks may have been CO based on the jack %-age in the swim-ins and lake samples.

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated chum escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 1991-06-10 to 1991-09-30. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. No record of chum being observed so "None Observed" has been entered as escapement estimate. Comment on original 1991 BC16 for the Somass System. Surveyed by electronic counters and helicopter surveys listed for Sept. 17th, October 10th, and November 1st. Spawning distribution: very few chinook spawned below Stamp Falls this year. Evidence of digging up eggs by later spawning fish, very likely with chinook with nearly 100,000 spawning in upper river. Sockeye enhanced in GCL through fertilization - an introduced stock. Hatchery enhancement on coho and chinook. Coho counts do not include tributaries below Stamp Falls, this means no counts for the entire Sproat System, Kitsucksis, Rogers Creek, Cheery Creek, Deer Creek, Beaver Creek, etc. BC16 Report prepared by B Rushton. | na | nan

Survey conducted 2016-09-20 &,2016-10-13 has been excluded from AUC calculation due to very poor survey conditions. A small rain event brought fish in early (Late Aug), then a second Sept 21st or so brought in an additional pulse of fish. A mark recapture program was conducted by NTC to estimate chinook abundance. They also applied radio tags to chum to measure survey life. Mark Recapture estimate of chinook in the lower pool produced by the NTC was 10,444. 63 radio tags put on chum in the lower pool (19 Sept 20, 44 Oct 11/12). The time between movement into the survey area, above the tagging pool, and death was around 5.6 days for both groups. The time between tagging and death was longer for the chum tagged earlier (15.5 days for chum tagged Sept 19th, 8.6 days for chum tagged Oct 11/12th). The expanded AUC was used as the escapement estimate. 222 chinook removed by Conuma Hatchery Sept 16, very few jacks observed, based on the one day of brood capture, hatchery staff estimated ~4,650 natural spawners. Drone and jet boat used to look for chinook.

Helicopter survey conducted 2017-09-14 and was excluded from the AUC calculation because it is a different survey method. The snorkel surveys of Nitinat River were planned to provide a rough estimate of Chum and Chinook for management purposes. Water levels were below normal for all swims except for the Oct. 26th swim where levels were normal. Broodstock was removed from the hatchery, lake and river: 1,114 from hatchery + 383 from the lake + 0 from the river = 1,497 adults & 383 from hatchery + 15 from the lake + 0 from river = 398 jacks; in addition to 369 adult fish removed from the lake by First Nations with a scientific permit and for food fish and an estimated 200 adults removed from the river by the sport fishery. Total removals equal 1,683 adults and 398 jacks. The Nitinat hatchery escapement estimate was roughly 2,500 adults based on the number of swim-ins and the proportion hatchery in the river samples.

Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 2003-05-15 to 2003-10-16. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. No record of chum being observed so "None Observed" has been entered as escapement estimate. No SEN created for 2003. Chum estimate for the Somass System = Somass River + Kitsucksus Creek + Cherry Creek + Sproat River + Stamp River, Lower + Stamp River, Upper + Beaver Creek + Deer Creek.

Person Preparing Report: Rick Ferguson, StAD (250) 756-7006 Field Crew: WCVI Snorkel Survey Crew and CPV Other Unusual Conditions: Yes Recommend Spawning Site Restoration: Yes Other Comments (May relate to several species): (5) General Comments on Escapement Estimation: High densities of coho juveniles were observed. There were two age groups of coho present (fry and yearlings). Detailed information for each inspection available from Stock Assessment Division. Surveys were initiated in July to enumerate summer run coho that hold in Toquart Lake until water levels increase and water temperatures drop. Heli-logging continues in the upper river. Surveys were performed on the river until December 2000. (15) General Comments on Unusual Conditions: The immediate lake outlet had significant green filamentous alga growth. It is hypothesized that waste food and faecal matter from the DFO/community hatchery net pen site in the lake is contributing to this alga accumulation. Water quality testing undertaken by DFO is recommended at the pen site and downstream in the lake outlet. It is also necessary to test a site upstream of the lake to be used as a control. Upstream of Toquart Lake the river has an appearance of being relatively unproductive. There is very little algal growth and the water was much colder. (17) Spawning site recommendations: The first 100-200 m of the lake outlet offers excellent opportunities for gravel placement. High quality gravel placed here should be very resilient and produce high egg to fry survivals. Gravel placement would have to be done by helicopter or barged down the lake from the boat launch site. | na | nan

Stamp Falls Fishway - continuous count, from 1988-09-18 to 1988-11-20. No chums were recorded going through the Stamp Falls fishway. It is unknown if chums were observed or if present whether they would be enumerated so "Not Inspected" has been entered as the escapement estimate. Chum estimate for the Somass System = Somass River + Kitsucksus Creek + Cherry Creek + Sproat River + Stamp River, Lower + Stamp River, Upper + Beaver Creek + Deer Creek. A small portion of chum make it through Stamp Falls Fishway, the majority of chum spawn in the Somass Mainstem or Lower Sproat River, a few spawn in the Lower Stamp River. Comment on original 1988 BC16 for the Somass System. Monitored regularly by electronic fish counters, video cameras and fishways by division bio staff. Sockeye enhanced by lake fertilization program (PBS) and chinook, coho, and steelhead enhanced by Robertson Creek Hatchery.

Coho - throughout mainstem and all tribs. Other Comments (May relate to several species): (5) General Comments on Escapement Estimation: The natural murkey water in this system combined with old logging debris and many tributaries makes an acurate assessment virtually imposssible once fish enter the fresh water. At present the best method of assessment is spot checks at the mouth during high tide on a calm day. Schoold of fish can be counted as they move about in the bay. A small speed boad is neccesary here. Bank walk was also conducted on Nov. 10th - no fish observed. (7) Enhancements: A stream clearing project (Forest Renewal BC) was under taken again this summer. 9 log jams were removed with some LWD anchored in place. The majority of the work took place from the bridge (mainstem to the National Park boundry). Removals for broodstock: Coho - 34 females (were taken for egg takes) and 40 males (were taken for milt) which produced 64,000 eggs. Released data from 96 brood year.

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated chinook escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 2005-05-05 to 2005-11-10. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. No record of chinook being observed so "None Observed" has been entered as escapement estimate. Chinook estimate for the Somass System = Somass River + Sproat River + Stamp River, Lower + Stamp River, Upper (the count through Stamp Falls Fishway plus a snorkel survey of the upper Stamp to the falls prior to the fishway going in). 1 additional snorkel surveys to the Somass System this year: Stamp River - Sept. 8th. | na | nan

The Nitinat River was surveyed 3 times in 2016. Four full snorkel surveys of Nitinat were planned to provide a rough estimate of Chum and Chinook for management purposes. Two full surveys and one partial survey were completed due to poor weather conditions. Water levels were too high for swims for much of mid-Oct through mid-November. Poor survey conditions during the peak chum observation. The estimate was derived from consultation with experienced hatchery staff, local First Nations and fisherman. Broodstock was removed from the hatchery, lake and river: 46,593 from hatchery + 64,107 from the lake + 0 from the river = 110,700 adults; in addition to 34,479 adult fish removed from the lake by First Nations for food fish and no estimate for adults removed from the river by the sport fishery. The total removals equal 145,179 adults. This estimate does not include Caycuse River, Doobah Creek, Campus Creek or Hobiton River which also drain into Nitinat Lake. Nitinat Hatchery staff estimate roughly 20,000 additional chum spawned in the Nitinat Lake tributaries.

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated coho escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 1997-05-27 to 1997-09-26. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. Both adult and jack coho recored as being observed in the counter calibration data and during snorkel surveys of the Taylor River so "Presence" has been entered as escapement estimate. Comment on original 1997 BC16 for the Somass System. Sockeye estimate: Great Central Lake (GCL) and Sproat fishway from May 27 to Oct.4. Coho estimate: Stamp Falls fishway from Sept. 2 to Nov. 10. Chum estimate: Most spawning takes place from below Stamp Falls Counts from Stamp Falls fishway (107) and snorkel swims below the fishway (4,252).

Additional surveys include a partial survey from the lake to Sturgeon Pool (approx. 1,500m) on October 27th and a drone survey at the mouth the Nitinat River on Oct 26 which targeted chum salmon. "According to the hatchery this year showed a large chum return with a significant push of spawners returning at the end of the typical spawning window with events of heavy rainfall. The majority of fish were observed below the hatchery pool (counting station 13). Huge numbers (in the thousands) entered the river following each large rain event. Prior to the peak the highest number of chum observed was 15,920 on 22-October-2020. On 27- October-2020, two surveys were conducted, one by boat to observe and quantify a significant number of chum holding in the lake at the mouth of the river and along the NW shore (surveyed area up to Sturgeon pool). The same day the lower Nitinat River was surveyed by helicopter. On the helicopter survey, Rob Brower and Graham Gibson counted 42,550 Chum that resided mostly below the hatchery pool. Helicopter surveys are ideal to compliment snorkel surveys to quantify such large returns, since it is difficult to differentiate between species from the helicopter and difficult to count fish across the entire width of the river while snorkeling." Comment provided by M.C.Wright and Associates who conducted the snorkel surveys with members of the Ditidaht First Nation. Nitinat hatchery staff collected 5,438 adults from hatchery swim-ins and 26,396 adults from the lake, of which 9,428 adults were used for brood. An additional 15,742 adults were removed from the lake in the First Nation ESSR fishery and for native food fish. Total removals include 47,576. The Nitinat Hatchery estimates 120,000 natural chum spawners in the river and 9,000 natural chums spawners in the Nitinat Lake tributaries.

Upper and lower surveys conducted on 2016-09-12 & 2016-09-13 and 2016-10-03 & 2016-10-04 have been combined for AUC and PL+D calculation. No helicopter surveys were done in 2016. The Nitinat River was surveyed 3 times in 2016. Four full snorkel surveys of Nitinat were planned to provide a rough estimate of Chum and Chinook for management purposes. Two full surveys and one partial survey were completed due to poor weather conditions. Water levels were too high for swims for much of mid-Oct through mid-November. The estimate was derived from consultation with experienced hatchery staff, local First Nations and fishermen. Broodstock was removed from the hatchery, lake and river: 581 from hatchery + 1,612 from the lake + 3,349 from the river = 5,542 adults & 15 from hatchery + 0 from the lake + 392 from river = 407 jacks & jimmies; in addition to 1,398 adult fish removed from the lake by First Nations for an ESSR and food fish and 300 adults from the lake and 300 adults from the river were removed by the sport fishery. Total removals equal 7,540 adults and 407 jacks.

Snorkel surveys conducted 2016-09-22; 2016-10-24 & 2016-11-18. Chum Creek was surveyed three times, once by NTC (Sep 22), twice by BCCF, Oct 24 and Nov 18, in 2016. Due to the heavy rains that persisted throughout October, the windows available for additional surveys were very small. Due to the high flows throughout the fall of 2016, dead counts were minimal as it is assumed that carcasses have been washed out of the system.

The Muchalaht/Mowachaht First Nation conducted 14 swim surveys doing a Chinook and chum Mark Recapture and a DFO contractor did 3 swim surveys - there were two surveys done on Sept 7th but only the survey done by the DFO contractor was added because the other survey was only a partial survey. The following partial surveys have been excluded from AUC calculation 2013-09-04; 2013-09-10; 2013-09-13 & 2013-09-16. Survey conducted 2013-10-07 excluded from AUC calculation due to poor visibility and survey conducted 2013-10-24 excluded from AUC calculation due to low % population observed.

Poor survey timing for pink, only 2 pink salmon was observed one on the first two surveys so Adult Presence was entered as the escapement estimate. Upper and lower river surveys were conducted simultaneously on the same day. Increased turbidity and clear skies make observations in pools and deeper sections difficult. All surveys were conducted in zero precipitation at the time of survey. Most surveys were conducted when the water level was above normal, but never during flooded conditions. Fish always had access to the Nitinat River; therefore increased rain did not dictate available access. A large amount of erosion is occurring in the lower section of Nitinat from counting station 7-4. Counting station 7 is continuously changing from a large log jam that requires walking around on the gravel bar to being able to swim through. Care should be taken when swimming on this river as it is forever changing.

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated chinook escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 1985-05-29 to 1985-10-08. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. No record of chinook being observed so "None Observed" has been entered as escapement estimate. Comment on original 1985 BC16 for the Somass System. Water levels very low in November. Distribution of spawning salmon: chum in lower river, chinook throughout Sproat and Stamp Rivers, sockeye in lakes, steelhead and coho throughout. Predation normal by wild animals and heavy by man. minor evidence of digging up eggs by later spawning chinook. Obstructions: passable by fishways, falls on Sproat and Stamp River, control dam on Stamp River. In addition to a 5 page supplemental report attached to the BC16, there the following comment not captured on the BC16: Again in 1985 no estimates of spawners utilizing tributary streams in the Somass watershed were carried out due to insufficient manpower .... list of tributaries .... lack of inspections due primarily to 1/3 reduction in Fishery Officer staff in Area 23 and extended duties associated with Area 22 chum fishery. Unable to read the name of the person preparing the BC16 report. | na | nan

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated coho escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 1988-06-10 to 1988-09-22. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. Both adult and jack coho recored as being observed in the counter calibration data so "Presence" has been entered as escapement estimate. Comment on original 1988 BC16 for the Somass System. Monitored regularly by electronic fish counters, video cameras and fishways by division bio staff. Sockeye enhanced by lake fertilization program (PBS) and chinook, coho, and steelhead enhanced by Robertson Creek Hatchery. No fish counted by video camera at Stamp Falls due to flood between Nov. 1st and Nov. 9th. Normal water fluctuations. Salmon distribution: chums in lower reaches. Predation: unknown - poaching.

Snorkel surveys were conducted on 2019-10-25 & 2019-11-15. Poor survey conditions and coverage this year, only two survey conducted targeting chum. Coho were observed on both surveys so the expanded PL+D was used as the escapement estimate. Higher flow makes surveying difficult in some areas due to increased turbidity and safety. The visibility was limited at the upstream end due to silt and limited light. The upstream end has a lot of large woody debris and aquatic vegetation on the creek bed. The canon section near the downstream end is deep in sections and very dark making visibility impossible in sections.

In 2016, the Leiner River was snorkelled 7 times between September 8 and November 18 with an average survey frequency of 10 days. The spacing of rain events during September, October and November allowed crews to schedule swims at timely intervals and thereby closely track salmon migration throughout the fall season; we consider the data to be reliable. In 2016, Leiner Chinook, like other salmon species, responded quickly to the heavy rains and high water conditions of early September and entered the river early. High water early in September is a key factor in attracting Chinook migrants into the river. A review of recent history shows that the coincidence of early season high water conditions and large Chinook counts has occurred about 9 times since 1995. This occurred again this year. In 2016, the peak Chinook count of 1300 fish occurred on September 6, the first survey of the season. This count is more than 4 times the escapement average for this system and second only to the ~1500 adults recorded in 1974. The distribution of Chinook in the Leiner is limited primarily to the lower 2 Km of the river. A handful of fish occasionally migrate above the steep cascade at Marker 4 but many years of swim data indicates the preferred habitat is below this point. In 2015 and 2016 we observed less than 2% of the count above Marker 4. The Tahsis Enhancement Society removed 157 chinook for broodstock (66 females + 77 males were used and 6 females + 8 males were pre-spawn morts). The expanded AUC was used for the escapement estimate.

Snorkel surveys were conducted on both the upper and lower river on 2015-09-17 (lower); 2015-10-05 (upper); 2015-10-06 (lower); 2015-10-21 (lower); 2015-10-22 (upper); & 2015-11-05 (upper) along with two helicopter surveys on 2015-09-27 & 201510-14. The helicopter surveys have been excluded from AUC calculations because this is a poor survey method for Chinook. Upper and lower surveys conducted on 2015-10-05 and 2015-10-06 & 2015-10-21 and 2015-10-22 have been combined for AUC and PL+D calculation. Broodstock was removed from the hatchery, the lake and river: 1,087 from hatchery + 1,131 from the lake + 989 from river = 3,207 adults & 47 from hatchery + 18 from lake + 58 from river = 123 jacks and immature; in addition to 1,357 adult fish removed from the river by first nations for food fish and Native ESSR. Total removals equal 4,564 adults and 123 jacks and immature. The hatchery reported water quality very poor in the river and in the surface of the lake. They also saw fresh fish unspawned on shore of Nitinat Lake. Disease combined with environmental stressors most likely stressed fish. Water than normal water (El-Nino affect) and very polluted river water due to poor flushing of dead fish. | na | nan

Data was reviewed February 2009 by Jeff Till. Total escapement estimate from 1996 PSARC Abundance Forecast report. Swim-in nos from 1996 PSARC Abundance Forecast report. Broodstock nos. from OHEB Escapement Database. Estimates include: video recordings from Sept 18 to Nov 9, 1986 were reviewed post season assignment (based on species and adult/jack composition identified in the fishway) of salmon of unknown species to a species/lifestage category Original installation and methodology for 1986 project is unclear. The accuracy of the original tape reading was questioned so video tapes were re-read twice around 1988. It is unclear which of these re-reads (or combination thereof) were used to determine final escapement numbers. No adjustments were made to the video counts or species compositions based manual verifications/calibrations. There is no estimate of naturally spawning jacks. 0 Jimmies observed.

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated chum escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 1988-06-10 to 1988-09-22. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. No record of chum being observed so "None Observed" has been entered as escapement estimate. Comment on original 1988 BC16 for the Somass System. Monitored regularly by electronic fish counters, video cameras and fishways by division bio staff. Sockeye enhanced by lake fertilization program (PBS) and chinook, coho, and steelhead enhanced by Robertson Creek Hatchery.

The Nitinat River was surveyed 3 times in 2016. Four full snorkel surveys of Nitinat were planned to provide a rough estimate of Chum and Chinook for management purposes. Two full surveys and one partial survey were completed due to poor weather conditions. Water levels were too high for swims for much of mid-Oct through mid-November. The expanded PL+D was used for the escapement method. Broodstock was removed from the hatchery, lake and river: 1,548 from hatchery + 256 from the lake + 335 from the river = 2,139 adults & 52 from hatchery + 0 from the lake + 15 from river = 67 jacks; in addition to 250 adult fish removed from the lake by First Nations for food fish and an estimated 100 adults removed from the river by the sport fishery.

Upper and lower river snorkel surveys were conducted on 2020-08-25; 2020-09-10; 2020-09-18; 2020-10-01; 2020-10-08; 2020-10-21 & 2020-11-09. Helicopter surveys were conducted 2020-10-17 & 2020-10-27, they were excluded from the estimate calculation due to different survey method. Additional surveys include a partial survey from the lake to Sturgeon Pool (approx. 1,500m) on October 27th and a drone survey at the mouth the Nitinat River on Oct 26 which targeted chum salmon. "Based on the Chinook return documented in 2019, the 2020 return was slightly smaller. The peak count of adult Chinook was 8,840 and 20 Chinook Jacks on 1-October 2020. Surveyors also observed a peak count of 1,845 Chinook "Jimmies" on 1-October 2020. "According to the Nitinat Hatchery, it is rare to see them in such abundance. The reason for this occurrence is currently unknown. One hatchery staff member hypothesized that these fish remained in the lake and never reached the ocean before returning to the river with the mature adult spawners." Comment provided by M.C.Wright and Associates who conducted the snorkel surveys with members of the Ditidaht First Nation. Nitinat hatchery staff collected 210 adults, 10 jacks, and 739 jimmies from hatchery swim-ins and 15,613 adults, 250 jacks, and 0 jimmies from the lake, of which 2,711 adults and 71 jacks were used for brood. 600 adult chinook were estimated to be removed from the river by sport fishery and an additional 4,273 were removed from the lake in the First Nation ESSR fishery and for native food fish. Total removals include 20,696 adults, 260 jacks and 739 jimmies. The Nitinat Hatchery estimates 12,00 natural chinook adult spawners and 500 jack chinook in the river.

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated coho escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 2004-05-18 to 2004-11-03. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. Both adult and jack coho recored as being observed in the counter calibration data and coho were recorded in the bypass data so "Presence" has been entered as escapement estimate.

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated chinook escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 1998-05-15 to 1998-10-15. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. Adult chinook recored as being observed in the counter calibration data and both adults and jacks were observed during snorkel surveys of the Taylor River so "Presence" has been entered as escapement estimate. Comment on original 1998 BC16 for the Somass System. Escapement Estimations: Total adult count excludes hatchery removals. Jack counts include hatchery includes hatchery removals. Sockeye escapement: Great Central Lake (GCL) and Sproat fishway counts May 21 - Oct. 19. Total count by electronic counters at Great Central Lake (GCL) and Sproat fishway. Though to be very accurate but manual observations and bio-sampling resulted in 106,000 - 203,000 jacks respectively. These were averaged then deducted from the total return to give the adult spawners. Coho escapement: Counts from Stamp Falls fishway from Sept. 2 to Nov. 10 (adjusted) and Taylor River snorkel swims. Pink escapement: Most spawning takes place from below Stamp Falls and these were not enumerated in 1998 due to poor flying conditions at optimum period. Chum escapement: Most spawning takes place from below Stamp Falls and these were not enumerated in 1998 due to poor flying conditions at optimum period. Chinook escapement: Chinook: Observations by experienced crews on Stamp River did not support the chinook escapement levels observed migrating through Stamp Falls. Applying pre-spawn mortality rates observed in Robertson Creek hatchery resulted in a range of 8,327 - 11,466 female successfully spawned in the Stamp River. Only the optimum spawning beds were used by chinook. Density in these areas were though to be ideal. Estimated 4,000 pre-spawn morts below Stamp Falls included in estimate.

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated chum escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 1997-05-27 to 1997-09-26. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. One chum was observed during a snorkel survey on the Taylor River so "Adult Presence" has been entered as escapement estimate. Comment on original 1997 BC16 for the Somass System. Sockeye estimate: Great Central Lake (GCL) and Sproat fishway from May 27 to Oct.4. Coho estimate: Stamp Falls fishway from Sept. 2 to Nov. 10. Chum estimate: Most spawning takes place from below Stamp Falls Counts from Stamp Falls fishway (107) and snorkel swims below the fishway (4,252).

In 2016, the Leiner River was snorkelled 7 times between September 8 and November 18 with an average survey frequency of 10 days. The spacing of rain events during September, October and November allowed crews to schedule swims at timely intervals and thereby closely track salmon migration throughout the fall season; we consider the data to be reliable. In 2016, Coho entered the Leiner during the first week in September. This early entry was similar to 2015 and is probably due to these fish responding to optimum migration flows from late August/early September rains. More rain and high water conditions through mid September drew in more adults, reaching a peak count of 1368 Coho on September 22; this is about 2-3 weeks earlier than peak counts recorded since 2011. Also noted this year was the sharp decline in Coho numbers in subsequent swims. This decrease is likely due to two factors: some early-entry Coho taking advantage of mid season flow pulses to move into canyon habitat upstream of Marker 7 and out of the survey area; and an unknown number of fish moving from the Leiner into the Perry system. This latter suggestion was confirmed when the swim crew observed about 50 Coho holding in the deep run under the bridge on the lower Perry (350m u/s of Leiner confluence).In 2016, Coho entered the Leiner during the first week in September.

Early September was the first storm of the season creating flood conditions and water levels were dropping during the first survey Sept. 12th. There was a large pulse of chinook that can in during the first storm. There is a high probability that the chinook quickly moved upstream above the survey area because the next survey, very few chinook were observed.

In 2016, the Colonial/Cayeghle system was snorkel surveyed 5 times between early September and mid-Oct. All surveys had excellent conditions with the exception of Sep 27 when above normal water levels compromised visibility. Generally good survey conditions but coverage may have missed the peak chum and coho. Snorkel surveys conducted 2016-09-07; 2016-09-13, 2016-09-27; 2016-10-03 & 2016-10-11.

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated chinook escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 1999-05-24 to 1999-09-30. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. No record of chinook being observed so "None Observed" has been entered as escapement estimate. No BC16 created for 1999. Chinook estimate for the Somass System = Somass River + Sproat River + Stamp River, Lower + Stamp River, Upper (the count through Stamp Falls Fishway plus a snorkel survey of the upper Stamp to the falls prior to the fishway going in). 15 additional snorkel surveys to the Somass System this year: Ash River (1) - Sept. 22nd; Sproat River (2) - Sept. 20th & Oct. 1st; Stamp River (9) - Sept. 16th, 19th, 22nd, 30th, Oct. 5th, 12th, 19th, 27th & Nov. 4th; and Taylor River (3) - Oct 1st, 8th & 27th. | na | nan

Helicopter survey conducted 2017-09-14 and was excluded from the AUC calculation because it is a different survey method. The snorkel surveys of Nitinat River were planned to provide a rough estimate of Chum and Chinook for management purposes. Water levels were below normal for all swims except for the Oct. 26th swim where levels were normal. Broodstock was removed from the hatchery, lake and river: 7,819 from hatchery + 30,792 from the lake + 0 from the river = 38,611 adults; in addition to 23,582 adult fish removed from the lake by First Nations for an ESSR and food fish and an estimated 100 adults removed from the river and 100 from the lake by the sport fishery. Total removals equal 62,393 adults. The Nitinat hatchery escapement estimate was roughly 95,000 adults plus 4,000 from Nitinat Lake tributaries .

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated pink escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Stamp Falls Fishway - continuous count, from 1986-09-18 to 1986-11-09. No pinks were recorded going through the Stamp Falls fishway. It is unknown if pinks were observed or if present whether they would be enumerated so "Not Inspected" has been entered as the escapement estimate. Very few pinks make it through Stamp Falls, it is unknown where pink spawn or number of spawning fish. Comment on original 1986 BC16 for the Somass System. Water levels very low Sept - Nov. Salmon distribution: pinks and chums lower 20 miles, chinook upper rivers below lakes, sockeye in lakes and tribs. Predation: minimal by animals and heavy by humans.

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated coho escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 1986-06-04 to 1986-10-02. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. Both adult and jack coho recored as being observed in the counter calibration data so "Presence" has been entered as escapement estimate. Comment on original 1986 BC16 for the Somass System.

Helicopter surveys were conducted 2020-10-17 & 2020-10-27, they were excluded from the estimate calculation due to different survey method. Additional surveys include a partial survey from the lake to Sturgeon Pool (approx. 1,500m) on October 27th and a drone survey at the mouth the Nitinat River on Oct 26 which targeted chum salmon. The snorkel survey conducted 2020-08-25 was excluded because it was an early zero count. "The Coho return in 2020 was approximately double compared to that in 2019. The highest number of Coho counted in the lower Nitinat occurred on 8-October-2020 at 1,007 adults and 86 Coho jacks. The highest number of Coho counted in the upper Nitinat River occurred on 1-October-2020 at 152 adults and 53 Coho jacks. A common comment across surveys was that low light in deep pools made identifying holding Coho difficult. Fast moving water and increased turbidity after major rain events made surveying areas where Coho typical reside such as undercut banks and around large woody debris more difficult to survey." Comment provided by M.C.Wright and Associates who conducted the snorkel surveys with members of the Ditidaht First Nation. Nitinat hatchery staff collected 501 adults and 884 jacks from hatchery swim-ins, 313 adults and 14 jacks from the lake, and 0 adults and 0 jacks from the river of which 299 adults and 1 jacks were used for brood. 100 adult coho were estimated to be removed from the river by sport fishery and an additional 158 adults were removed from the river for native food fish. Total removals include 1,072 adults and 898 jacks. The Nitinat Hatchery estimates 1,500 natural coho adult spawners in the river.

Person Preparing Report: Doug Palfrey Field Crew: Tofino/Thorton Ck Hatchery Crew Distribution of Spawning Salmon: Chum all below first bridge. Chinook in pool below bridge. Other Comments (May relate to several species): (5) General Comments on Escapement Estimation: This system rises quickly from tidal area to the falls. Many boulders throughout with some cobble. Pockets of good spawning gravel exists but are sparse. Potentially a good side channel exists on the right side of the river. It exits approximately 40 metres below the bridge. The channel measures 220 metres in length with the width being 10 meters. During periods of low flows, it is dry. At present it is not being utilised by fish, however with some equipment work at its mouth this could become a viable spawning channel. This is possibly being investigated over the next couple of months. The falls appear to be impassable (at 1.3km,) an excellent spawning and rearing habitat exists for a few kilometres above. A fish ladder could open this area up for the fish to access. | neutral | 0.9312237501144409

Survey conducted 2014-08-21 & 2014-08-28 were excluded because they were early zero counts and the survey conducted 2014-09-29 was excluded due to poor survey conditions. 2014-09-30 survey covered only a portion of the survey section, so a %pop expansion of 44% was applied based on the average % observed in the covered section (14-6) vs full survey (14-0) in the previous two full surveys. The NTC did a Chinook mark recapture program so their surveys targeted Chinook. Chinook jack were only observed on the September 27th survey and crews did not record any dead Chinook while doing the mark recapture program. Also, there was a large difference in the number of fish observed by each survey crew on the October 7th survey. Heavy rains in mid to late October created poor survey conditions. Survey crews were unable to conduct surveys due to high water levels and dangerous river conditions. The Expanded PL+D estimate would normally be used as the escapement estimate.

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated coho escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 1985-05-29 to 1985-10-08.The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. Both adult and jack coho recored as being observed in the counter calibration data so "Presence" has been entered as escapement estimate. Comment on original 1985 BC16 for the Somass System. Water levels very low in November. Distribution of spawning salmon: chum in lower river, chinook throughout Sproat and Stamp Rivers, sockeye in lakes, steelhead and coho throughout. Predation normal by wild animals and heavy by man. minor evidence of digging up eggs by later spawning chinook. Obstructions: passable by fishways, falls on Sproat and Stamp River, control dam on Stamp River. In addition to a 5 page supplemental report attached to the BC16, there the following comment not captured on the BC16: Again in 1985 no estimates of spawners utilizing tributary streams in the Somass watershed were carried out due to insufficient manpower .... list of tributaries .... lack of inspections due primarily to 1/3 reduction in Fishery Officer staff in Area 23 and extended duties associated with Area 22 chum fishery.

Chum estimate for the Somass System = Somass River + Kitsucksus Creek + Cherry Creek + Sproat River + Stamp River, Lower + Stamp River, Upper + Beaver Creek + Deer Creek. A small portion of chum make it through Stamp Falls Fishway, the majority of chum spawn in the Somass Mainstem or Lower Sproat River, a few spawn in the Lower Stamp River. Comment on original 1991 BC16 for the Somass System. Surveyed by electronic counters and helicopter surveys listed for Sept. 17th, October 10th, and November 1st. Spawning distribution: very few chinook spawned below Stamp Falls this year. Evidence of digging up eggs by later spawning fish, very likely with chinook with nearly 100,000 spawning in upper river. Sockeye enhanced in GCL through fertilization - an introduced stock. Hatchery enhancement on coho and chinook. Coho counts do not include tributaries below Stamp Falls, this means no counts for the entire Sproat System, Kitsucksis, Rogers Creek, Cheery Creek, Deer Creek, Beaver Creek, etc. BC16 Report prepared by B Rushton. | na | nan

The helicopter survey was excluded from the AUC calculation due to difference in survey methods. Upper and lower river surveys were conducted simultaneously on the same day. Nitinat hatchery staff collected 3,916 adults from hatchery swim-ins and 5,777 adults from the lake, of which 3,594 adults were used for brood. An additional 8,398 adults were removed from the lake in the First Nation ESSR fishery and for native food fish. Total removals include 18,091. Increased turbidity and clear skies make observations in pools and deeper sections difficult. All surveys were conducted in zero precipitation at the time of survey. Most surveys were conducted when the water level was above normal, but never during flooded conditions. Fish always had access to the Nitinat River; therefore increased rain did not dictate available access. A large amount of erosion is occurring in the lower section of Nitinat from counting station 7-4. Counting station 7 is continuously changing from a large log jam that requires walking around on the gravel bar to being able to swim through. Care should be taken when swimming on this river as it is forever changing.

Somass system data reviewed February & March 2006. Updated sockeye escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Biologist Diana Dobson. Sockeye estimate for the Somass System = Sproat Lake (the count through Sproat Lake - May to end of Oct.) + Great Central Lake (the count through GCL - May to end of Aug. plus the Stamp Falls Fishway Count - Sept to end of Oct.). Comment on original 1998 BC16 for the Somass System. Escapement Estimations: Total adult count excludes hatchery removals. Jack counts include hatchery includes hatchery removals. Sockeye escapement: Great Central Lake (GCL) and Sproat fishway counts May 21 - Oct. 19. Total count by electronic counters at Great Central Lake (GCL) and Sproat fishway. Though to be very accurate but manual observations and bio-sampling resulted in 106,000 - 203,000 jacks respectively. These were averaged then deducted from the total return to give the adult spawners. Coho escapement: Counts from Stamp Falls fishway from Sept. 2 to Nov. 10 (adjusted) and Taylor River snorkel swims. Pink escapement: Most spawning takes place from below Stamp Falls and these were not enumerated in 1998 due to poor flying conditions at optimum period. Chum escapement: Most spawning takes place from below Stamp Falls and these were not enumerated in 1998 due to poor flying conditions at optimum period. Chinook escapement: Chinook: Observations by experienced crews on Stamp River did not support the chinook escapement levels observed migrating through Stamp Falls. Applying pre-spawn mortality rates observed in Robertson Creek hatchery resulted in a range of 8,327 - 11,466 female successfully spawned in the Stamp River.

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated coho escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 1998-05-15 to 1998-10-15. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. Both adult and jack coho recored as being observed in the counter calibration data, during snorkel surveys of the Taylor River and adult coho recorded in the bypass data so "Presence" has been entered as escapement estimate. Comment on original 1998 BC16 for the Somass System. Escapement Estimations: Total adult count excludes hatchery removals. Jack counts include hatchery includes hatchery removals. Sockeye escapement: Great Central Lake (GCL) and Sproat fishway counts May 21 - Oct. 19. Total count by electronic counters at Great Central Lake (GCL) and Sproat fishway. Though to be very accurate but manual observations and bio-sampling resulted in 106,000 - 203,000 jacks respectively. These were averaged then deducted from the total return to give the adult spawners. Coho escapement: Counts from Stamp Falls fishway from Sept. 2 to Nov. 10 (adjusted) and Taylor River snorkel swims. Pink escapement: Most spawning takes place from below Stamp Falls and these were not enumerated in 1998 due to poor flying conditions at optimum period. Chum escapement: Most spawning takes place from below Stamp Falls and these were not enumerated in 1998 due to poor flying conditions at optimum period. Chinook escapement: Chinook: Observations by experienced crews on Stamp River did not support the chinook escapement levels observed migrating through Stamp Falls. Applying pre-spawn mortality rates observed in Robertson Creek hatchery resulted in a range of 8,327 - 11,466 female successfully spawned in the Stamp River. Only the optimum spawning beds were used by chinook. Density in these areas were though to be ideal. Estimated 4,000 pre-spawn morts below Stamp Falls included in estimate.

Snorkel survey conducted 2014-09-17 was not entered because there was no survey or river information entered. There were two different survey crews conducting surveys in 2014. The NTC did a Chinook mark recapture program using radio tags so their surveys were bias only targeting live adult Chinook. No telemetry logs or by-tag summaries were submitted to Stock Assessment. Heavy rains in mid to late October created poor survey conditions. Survey crews were unable to conduct surveys due to high water levels and dangerous river conditions. Since there was a large discrepancy in the number of fish observed between the two survey crews, the SIL data provided through the mark recapture program has been excluded from the estimate calculations. The Expanded PL+D was used as the escapement estimate. Conuma River Hatchery staff removed 2,356 adults (1,188 male & 1,168 female) for broodstock. | neutral | 0.7186508774757385

Surveyed by electronic counters and helicopter surveys listed for Sept. 17th, October 10th, and November 1st. Spawning distribution: very few chinook spawned below Stamp Falls this year. Evidence of digging up eggs by later spawning fish, very likely with chinook with nearly 100,000 spawning in upper river. Sockeye enhanced in GCL through fertilization - an introduced stock. Hatchery enhancement on coho and chinook. Coho counts do not include tributaries below Stamp Falls, this means no counts for the entire Sproat System, Kitsucksis, Rogers Creek, Cheery Creek, Deer Creek, Beaver Creek, etc. BC16 Report prepared by B Rushton. | na | nan

The chinook count on Sept. 17th, is higher than what the hatchery estimated as the Total Escapement so the PL+D count on the Sept. 17th has been used as the escapement estimate. The following estimate comments were provided by the hatchery: "First set data indicated 21% males 10% females with 68% jacks. This was not a good indication of the ratio for the later part of the run. It was a difficult year to attain good first set data because fish were delayed due to low water some fish were released back into the same area. The actual % of jacks was around 10-20%. Brood capture began Sept 10/12 in the tidal waters of the Conuma estuary, some fish were transported to the hatchery and spawned at a later date. Very few fish moved in to the system until the Oct. 12 to 14th rain event (month late). Escapement estimates were derived from six hatchery staff visual estimates and two StAD swim counts. Counts from the Conuma channel and Leagh creek were included in the totals. The estimate does not include pre-spawn mortality due to algae blooms, predation or overripe fish. Some adults (25-30) were observed in the (river) tidal water dead and unspawned during a algae bloom event. It is not known to what extent or how far out into the bay this had an impact on the fish." | na | nan

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated coho escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 1993-06-04 to 1993-10-13. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. Adult coho recored as being observed in the counter calibration data and in Taylor River so "Presence" has been entered as escapement estimate. Comment on original 1993 BC16 for the Somass System. Salmon distribution: Taylor River sockeye distributed from Sproat Lake 1/2 way to Highway bridge. Coho in deep pools throughout. Above sockeye data is unadjusted figure from counters (J. Mitchell). Attached data for chinook from Rick Sample (DFO). Taylor River: 1956 sockeye counted, 385 coho counted, 6 steelhead. Name of person preparing the report not listed on the BC16.

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated chinook escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 1989-06-02 to 1989-09-30. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. No record of chinook being observed so "None Observed" has been entered as escapement estimate. Comment on original 1989 BC16 for the Somass System.

Somass system data reviewed February & March 2006. Updated sockeye escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Biologist Diana Dobson. Sockeye estimate for the Somass System = Sproat Lake (the count through Sproat Lake - May to end of Oct.) + Great Central Lake (the count through GCL - May to end of Aug. plus the Stamp Falls Fishway Count - Sept to end of Oct.). Comment on original 1988 BC16 for the Somass System. Monitored regularly by electronic fish counters, video cameras and fishways by division bio staff. Sockeye enhanced by lake fertilization program (PBS) and chinook, coho, and steelhead enhanced by Robertson Creek Hatchery. No fish counted by video camera at Stamp Falls due to flood between Nov. 1st and Nov. 9th. Normal water fluctuations. Salmon distribution: chums in lower reaches. Predation: unknown - poaching. Target escapement for sockeye (low end of optimum - 400k) 1,91,873 for GCL and 228,221 for Sproat. Springs counted by flash board and video camera. Target escapement for chinook is currently 102,000.

Peak counts over the last decade have been in the single digits with most observations consisting of post spawning males. In 2016 we observed 3 adults on September 7 and a single sighting a week later. In 2015 the peak count was marginally higher at 4 fish. These numbers are likely conservative but emphasize the Pink salmon escapement to this system is extremely small. The raw PL+D was used as the escapement estimate.

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated chum escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 1998-05-15 to 1998-10-15. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. No record of chum being observed so "None Observed" has been entered as escapement estimate. Comment on original 1998 BC16 for the Somass System. Escapement Estimations: Total adult count excludes hatchery removals. Jack counts include hatchery includes hatchery removals. Sockeye escapement: Great Central Lake (GCL) and Sproat fishway counts May 21 - Oct. 19. Total count by electronic counters at Great Central Lake (GCL) and Sproat fishway. Though to be very accurate but manual observations and bio-sampling resulted in 106,000 - 203,000 jacks respectively. These were averaged then deducted from the total return to give the adult spawners. Coho escapement: Counts from Stamp Falls fishway from Sept. 2 to Nov. 10 (adjusted) and Taylor River snorkel swims. Pink escapement: Most spawning takes place from below Stamp Falls and these were not enumerated in 1998 due to poor flying conditions at optimum period. Chum escapement: Most spawning takes place from below Stamp Falls and these were not enumerated in 1998 due to poor flying conditions at optimum period. Chinook escapement: Chinook: Observations by experienced crews on Stamp River did not support the chinook escapement levels observed migrating through Stamp Falls. Applying pre-spawn mortality rates observed in Robertson Creek hatchery resulted in a range of 8,327 - 11,466 female successfully spawned in the Stamp River. Only the optimum spawning beds were used by chinook. Density in these areas were though to be ideal. Estimated 4,000 pre-spawn morts below Stamp Falls included in estimate.

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated coho escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 1994-06-02 to 1994-09-30. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. Both adult and jack coho recored as being observed in the counter calibration data so "Presence" has been entered as escapement estimate. Comment on original 1994 BC16 for the Somass System. Fishway counts - Information from visual adjusted counts at Stamp Falls, Sept. 1st - Nov. 8th. 977 adult + 2,986 coho counted. Does not include spawners in tribs below Stamp Falls.

Person Preparing Report: Doug Palfrey Field Crew: Tofino/Thorton Ck Hatchery Crew Enhancement/Biological Activities: Yes Distribution of Spawning Salmon: Chum - mainly in the lower stretch to 3 km. Coho - throughout mainstem and many tributaries. Other Unusual Conditions: Yes Salmon Distribution or Predator Interactions: Yes Other Comments (May relate to several species): (15) General Comments on Unusual Conditions: Silt covers the bottom in many places, mostly in the mainstem and around the jams. (20) Predator Interactions: Some predation by bears occurs at the riffles in the lower reaches - approximately 60 chum. (7) Enhancements: This system was seriously impacted by poor logging practices. Many areas are paved with logging and shake debris with some stretches covering 50 metres long and 7 metres wide. In the summer of '94 a stream clearing project was initiated clearing out debris on the rifle range tributary. The summer of 1996 saw an FRBC stream clearing project started, three, five man crews cleared 4km of the upper reaches of the tributary. Tofino, and Thornton creek hatchery have been enhancing this system since 1992. The following is a list of released numbers: Brood Year Coho 1992 96,000 1993 81,000 1994 21,000 1995 55,000 In the fall of 1996, we had a total of 11 trips to Kootowis creek, 7 of these to collect broodstock. A total of 45 females and 48 males were gathered. At the present time, we have 100,161 Kootowis coho eggs. The natural tea coloured water in this system combined with a large number of log jams makes this a difficult system to access. The first 4 assessments were made by boat in the tidal bay area where counts are made by counting schools as they move in over the flats with the tide. The other trips were spot checks during our broodstock collection efforts. | na | nan

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated chinook escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 1992-06-04 to 1992-10-21. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. No record of chinook being observed so "None Observed" has been entered as escapement estimate. Comment on original 1992 BC16 for the Somass System. Electronic counters are used to enumerate sockeye, coho, and chinook - no coho counted in Sproat River System. Salmon distribution: Some chinook observed spawning below Stamp Falls downstream to Vista Road. Chinooks observed in McBride Creek and Doran Creek. Coho counts do not include tributary systems below Stamp Falls; all counts include jacks. Consultant to NTC used a Remote Underwater Camera to study sockeye spawning habitat in Great Central.

The helicopter survey was excluded from the AUC calculation due to difference in survey methods. Upper and lower river surveys were conducted simultaneously on the same day. Nitinat hatchery staff collected 1,016 adults, 67 jacks, and 1 jimmy from hatchery swim-ins and 5,177 adults, 80 jacks, and 81 jimmies from the lake, of which 2,645 adults and 52 jacks were used for brood. An additional 1,624 were removed from the lake in the First Nation ESSR fishery and for native food fish. Total removals include 7,817 adults, 147 jacks and 82 jimmies. Increased turbidity and clear skies make observations in pools and deeper sections difficult. All surveys were conducted in zero precipitation at the time of survey. Most surveys were conducted when the water level was above normal, but never during flooded conditions. Fish always had access to the Nitinat River; therefore increased rain did not dictate available access. A large amount of erosion is occurring in the lower section of Nitinat from counting station 7-4. Counting station 7 is continuously changing from a large log jam that requires walking around on the gravel bar to being able to swim through. Care should be taken when swimming on this river as it is forever changing.

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated coho escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 2000-05-26 to 2000-10-28. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. Both adult and jack coho recored as being observed in the counter calibration data, during snorkel surveys of the Taylor River and adult coho recorded in the bypass data so "Presence" has been entered as escapement estimate. No BC16 created for 2000. Coho estimate for the Somass System = Somass River + Rogers Creek + Kitsucksus Creek + Cherry Creek + McCoy Creek + Sproat River + Stamp River, Lower + Stamp River, Upper (the count through Stamp Falls Fishway plus the swim survey of the upper Stamp to the falls prior to the fishway going in) + Beaver Creek + Deer Creek. 17 additional snorkel surveys to the Somass System this year: Ash River (3) - Sept. 28th, Oct. 25th & Nov. 7th; Drinkwater Creek (3) - Oct. 10th, Nov. 2nd & Dec. 14th; McBride Creek (3) - Oct. 10th, Nov. 2nd & Dec. 15th; Stamp River (1) - Aug 8th; and Taylor River (7) - Oct 11th, 12th, 24th, 25th, 26, Nov. 29th & Dec. 6th. | na | nan

The estimate was derived from consultation with experienced hatchery staff, local First Nations and fishermen. Broodstock removed from the hatchery, lake and river: adults include 1,528 from hatchery + 29 from the lake + 564 from the river = 2,121 adults & jacks include 141 from hatchery + 10 from the river = 151 jacks; plus 437 adult fish removed from the lake by First Nations for an ESSR and scientific permit and an estimate of 100 adult chinook were removed from the river by the sport fishery. Total removals equal 2,658 adults and 151 jacks. Since the survey conducted Sept. 23 was fair, the unexpanded AUC was selected for the AUC calculation.

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated coho escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 1989-06-02 to 1989-09-30. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. Both adult and jack coho recored as being observed in the counter calibration data so "Presence" has been entered as escapement estimate. Comment on original 1989 BC16 for the Somass System. Monitored regularly by electronic fish counters, video cameras and fishways by division bio staff Sept. 14th to Nov. 15th. Sockeye enhanced by lake fertilization program (PBS) and chinook, coho, and steelhead enhanced by Robertson Creek Hatchery. Salmon distribution: Mostly chums spawn in lower reaches.

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated chum escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 1999-05-24 to 1999-09-30. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. No record of chum being observed so "None Observed" has been entered as escapement estimate. No BC16 created for 1999. Chum estimate for the Somass System = Somass River + Kitsucksus Creek + Cherry Creek + Sproat River + Stamp River, Lower + Stamp River, Upper + Beaver Creek + Deer Creek. A small portion of chum make it through Stamp Falls Fishway, the majority of chum spawn in the Somass Mainstem or Lower Sproat River, a few spawn in the Lower Stamp River. 15 additional snorkel surveys to the Somass System this year: Ash River (1) - Sept. 22nd; Sproat River (2) - Sept. 20th & Oct. 1st; Stamp River (9) - Sept. 16th, 19th, 22nd, 30th, Oct. 5th, 12th, 19th, 27th & Nov. 4th; and Taylor River (3) - Oct 1st, 8th & 27th. | na | nan

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated chum escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 2001-05-14 to 2001-11-13. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. One chum was observed during a snorkel survey on the Taylor River so "Adult Presence" has been entered as escapement estimate. No SEN created for 2001. Chum estimate for the Somass System = Somass River + Kitsucksus Creek + Cherry Creek + Sproat River + Stamp River, Lower + Stamp River, Upper + Beaver Creek + Deer Creek. A small portion of chum make it through Stamp Falls Fishway, the majority of chum spawn in the Somass Mainstem or Lower Sproat River, a few spawn in the Lower Stamp River. 31 additional surveys, 30snorkel and 1 aerial to the Somass System this year: Ash River (4 snkl) - Sept. 12th, Oct. 11th, 16th & 24th; Drinkwater Creek (2 snkl) - Nov. 2nd & 23rd; McBride Creek (2 snkl) Nov. 2nd & 23rd; Somass River (5 snkl / 1 Aerial) - Oct. 6th, 17th, 24th, 25th, 29th & Nov. 6th; Sproat River (4 snkl) - Oct. 6th, 17th, 25th & Nov. 9th; Stamp River (8 snkl) - Jul. 5th, 11th, Sept. 6th, Oct. 3rd, 16th, 18th, Nov. 6th & 8th; and Taylor River (5 snkl) - Sept. 21st, Oct. 19th, 23rd, 30th & Nov 27th. | na | nan

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated coho escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 2005-05-05 to 2005-11-10. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. Both adult and jack coho recored as being observed in the counter calibration data and coho were recorded in the bypass data so "Presence" has been entered as escapement estimate. Coho estimate for the Somass System = Somass River + Rogers Creek + Kitsucksus Creek + Cherry Creek + McCoy Creek + Sproat River + Stamp River, Lower + Stamp River, Upper (the count through Stamp Falls Fishway plus the swim survey of the upper Stamp to the falls prior to the fishway going in) + Beaver Creek + Deer Creek. 1 additional snorkel surveys to the Somass System this year: Stamp River - Sept. 8th. | na | nan

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated chinook escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 2004-05-18 to 2004-11-03. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. Adult chinook was recorded in the bypass data so "Presence" has been entered for the adult estimate and "None Observed" entered for the jack estimate. No SEN created for 2004. Chinook estimate for the Somass System = Somass River + Sproat River + Stamp River, Lower + Stamp River, Upper (the count through Stamp Falls Fishway plus a snorkel survey of the upper Stamp to the falls prior to the fishway going in). 1 additional snorkel surveys to the Somass System this year: Ash River - Sept. 30th, survey conducted by the Province. | na | nan

In 2016, heavy rains and rising water levels in early September provided the flow conditions necessary for Chinook to transit the shallow riffle habitat at Marker 0 and enter the river early. On September 7, 84 bright Chinook were observed holding in several large groups in the lower river. The count remained relatively unchanged until mid-September rains drew in the backbone of the run. On September 23, the peak count of 186 adults was recorded. This compares to the 2015 peak count of 230 adults on September 27. The 2016 count of 184 fish is about average when compared with peak tallies recorded since 2011 (74 - 470). The Tahsis Enhancement Society removed 111 chinook for broodstock (31 females + 74 males were used and 2 females + 4 males were pre-spawn morts). The expanded AUC was used as the escapement estimate.

In 2016, the Leiner River was snorkelled 7 times between September 8 and November 18 with an average survey frequency of 10 days. The spacing of rain events during September, October and November allowed crews to schedule swims at timely intervals and thereby closely track salmon migration throughout the fall season; we consider the data to be reliable. The first observation of bright Chum salmon in the Leiner was September 6. These adults probably entered a few days earlier, attracted up river by high flows brought on by heavy, late summer rain. The first major influx of Chum migrants was on September 22 when 1172 adults were counted. These fish probably entered the Leiner mid September when 96 mm of rain spiked flows. Subsequent surveys showed Chum numbers remained static over the next 3 weeks before rising quickly to the peak count of 4718 fish on October 12. The timing of the 2016 peak live count around mid October is consistent with peak counts recorded for Chum over the last 5 years (2011-2015). The distribution of Chum salmon in the Leiner is restricted to the lower 2 Km. We saw no indication of Chum adults moving past the steep cascade above the Head Bay Road bridge into the lower canyon. The expanded AUC was used for the escapement estimate.

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated coho escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 1987-06-22 to 1987-10-08. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. Both adult and jack coho recored as being observed in the counter calibration data so "Presence" has been entered as escapement estimate. Comment on original 1987 BC16 for the Somass System. Monitored regularly by electronic counters and division bio staff. Sockeye enhanced by lake fertilization program (PBS) and chinook, coho, and steelhead enhanced by Robertson Creek Hatchery. Water levels: late fall freshet - low flows delayed migration. Salmon distribution: chums mainly in lower reaches. Predation: unknown. New obstructions: none reported.

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated chum escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 2000-05-26 to 2000-10-28. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. No record of chum being observed so "None Observed" has been entered as escapement estimate. No BC16 created for 2000. Chum estimate for the Somass System = Somass River + Kitsucksus Creek + Cherry Creek + Sproat River + Stamp River, Lower + Stamp River, Upper + Beaver Creek + Deer Creek. A small portion of chum make it through Stamp Falls Fishway, the majority of chum spawn in the Somass Mainstem or Lower Sproat River, a few spawn in the Lower Stamp River. 17 additional snorkel surveys to the Somass System this year: Ash River (3) - Sept. 28th, Oct. 25th & Nov. 7th; Drinkwater Creek (3) - Oct. 10th, Nov. 2nd & Dec. 14th; McBride Creek (3) - Oct. 10th, Nov. 2nd & Dec. 15th; Stamp River (1) - Aug 8th; and Taylor River (7) - Oct 11th, 12th, 24th, 25th, 26, Nov. 29th & Dec. 6th. | na | nan

Snorkel surveys conducted 2016-09-06; 2016-09-16; 2016-09-22; 2016-10-02; 2016-10-12; 2016-11-01 & 2016-11-18. In 2016, the Leiner River was snorkelled 7 times between September 8 and November 18 with an average survey frequency of 10 days. The spacing of rain events during September, October and November allowed crews to schedule swims at timely intervals and thereby closely track salmon migration throughout the fall season; we consider the data to be reliable. In 2016, the peak count of 2258 Sockeye was made on September 22 and represents the highest count recorded in the last decade. The count dropped sharply over the next 3 weeks reaching approximately 600 fish by mid October. This sharp decline is not due to post spawning mortalities since Sockeye don¿t normally spawn until early November. The fact that few adults were observed upstream of the cascade at Marker 4 suggests a substantial number of Sockeye moved into the Perry. Volunteers from the Tahsis Community Hatchery and local Summer Steelhead fisherman reported Sockeye are commonly scene in the Perry as far upstream as the wetland, about 2.5 km above the Leiner confluence. This suggests that the Perry Sockeye population is significant and perhaps larger than the Leiner. This is a data gap that should be investigated further. The expanded AUC was used for the escapement estimate.

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated chinook escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 1988-06-10 to 1988-09-22. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. No record of chinook being observed so "None Observed" has been entered as escapement estimate. Comment on original 1988 BC16 for the Somass System. Monitored regularly by electronic fish counters, video cameras and fishways by division bio staff. Sockeye enhanced by lake fertilization program (PBS) and chinook, coho, and steelhead enhanced by Robertson Creek Hatchery. No fish counted by video camera at Stamp Falls due to flood between Nov. 1st and Nov. 9th. Normal water fluctuations. Salmon distribution: chums in lower reaches. Predation: unknown - poaching.

The survey conducted 2017-08-28 was excluded from the AUC calculation because it was a different survey method and the surveys conducted 2017-09-08; 2017-09-14; 2017-09-18; 2017-09-27; 2017-10-04 & 2017-10-09 were excluded because they were early zero counts, Survey conducted 2017-10-25 was poor survey conditions and the survey on 2017-10-17 was a late zero count. The Expanded PL+D was used as the escapement estimate due to difficulty in species ID.

Snorkel surveys were conducted on both the upper and lower river on 2015-09-17 (lower); 2015-10-05 (upper); 2015-10-06 (lower); 2015-10-21 (lower); 2015-10-22 (upper); & 2015-11-05 (upper) along with two helicopter surveys on 2015-09-27 & 201510-14. The helicopter surveys have been excluded from AUC calculations because this is a poor survey method for coho. Upper and lower surveys conducted on 2015-10-05 and 2015-10-06 & 2015-10-21 and 2015-10-22 have been combined for AUC and PL+D calculation. Broodstock was removed from both the river and hatchery: 1,048 from hatchery + 81 from river = 1,129 adults & 146 from hatchery + 56 from river = 202 jacks; in addition to 150 adult fish removed from the river by First Nations for food fish and 150 adults removed from the river by the sport fishery. Total removals equal 1,429 adults and 202 jacks. The hatchery reported water quality very poor in the river and in the surface of the lake. They also saw fresh fish unspawned on shore of Nitinat Lake. Disease combined with environmental stressors most likely stressed fish. Water than normal water (El-Nino affect) and very polluted river water due to poor flushing of dead fish. Coho smolts rearing on this river water were starting to die.

The helicopter survey was excluded from the AUC calculation due to difference in survey methods and the survey conducted 2019-11-21 was excluded because it was a late zero count. Upper and lower river surveys were conducted simultaneously on the same day. Increased turbidity and clear skies make observations in pools and deeper sections difficult. All surveys were conducted in zero precipitation at the time of survey. Most surveys were conducted when the water level was above normal, but never during flooded conditions. Fish always had access to the Nitinat River; therefore increased rain did not dictate available access. A large amount of erosion is occurring in the lower section of Nitinat from counting station 7-4. Counting station 7 is continuously changing from a large log jam that requires walking around on the gravel bar to being able to swim through. Care should be taken when swimming on this river as it is forever changing.

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated chinook escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 1991-06-10 to 1991-09-30. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. No record of chinook being observed so "None Observed" has been entered as escapement estimate. Comment on original 1991 BC16 for the Somass System. Surveyed by electronic counters and helicopter surveys listed for Sept. 17th, October 10th, and November 1st. Spawning distribution: very few chinook spawned below Stamp Falls this year. Evidence of digging up eggs by later spawning fish, very likely with chinook with nearly 100,000 spawning in upper river. Sockeye enhanced in GCL through fertilization - an introduced stock. Hatchery enhancement on coho and chinook. Coho counts do not include tributaries below Stamp Falls, this means no counts for the entire Sproat System, Kitsucksis, Rogers Creek, Cheery Creek, Deer Creek, Beaver Creek, etc. BC16 Report prepared by B Rushton. | na | nan

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated coho escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 1992-06-04 to 1992-10-21. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. Both adult and jack coho recored as being observed in the counter calibration data and coho were recorded in the bypass data so "Presence" has been entered as escapement estimate. Comment on original 1992 BC16 for the Somass System. Electronic counters are used to enumerate sockeye, coho, and chinook - no coho counted in Sproat River System. Salmon distribution: Some chinook observed spawning below Stamp Falls downstream to Vista Road. Chinooks observed in McBride Creek and Doran Creek. Coho counts do not include tributary systems below Stamp Falls; all counts include jacks. Consultant to NTC used a Remote Underwater Camera to study sockeye spawning habitat in Great Central.

Survey conducted 2016-10-13 has been excluded from AUC calculation due to very poor survey conditions. A small rain event brought fish in early (Late Aug), then a second Sept 21st or so brought in an additional pulse of fish. A mark recapture program was conducted by NTC to estimate chinook abundance. They also applied radio tags to chum to measure survey life. Mark Recapture estimate of chinook in the lower pool produced by the NTC was 10,444. 63 radio tags put on chum in the lower pool (19 Sept 20, 44 Oct 11/12). The time between movement into the survey area, above the tagging pool, and death was around 5.6 days for both groups. The time between tagging and death was longer for the chum tagged earlier (15.5 days for chum tagged Sept 19th, 8.6 days for chum tagged Oct 11/12th). The expanded AUC was used as the escapement estimate.

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated chum escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Stamp Falls Fishway - continuous count, from 1998-09-02 to 1998-11-10. 25 chum counted through Stamp Falls fishway. Chum estimate for the Somass System = Somass River + Kitsucksus Creek + Cherry Creek + Sproat River + Stamp River, Lower + Stamp River, Upper + Beaver Creek + Deer Creek. A small portion of chum make it through Stamp Falls Fishway, the majority of chum spawn in the Somass Mainstem or Lower Sproat River, a few spawn in the Lower Stamp River.

Snorkel surveys were conducted on both the upper and lower river on 2017-09-27 (lower only); 2017-10-05 (lower only); 2017-10-26 & 2017-11-01. Helicopter survey conducted 2017-09-14 and was excluded from the AUC calculation because it is a different survey method. The snorkel surveys of Nitinat River were planned to provide a rough estimate of Chum and Chinook for management purposes. Water levels were below normal for all swims except for the Oct. 26th swim where levels were normal. Due to timing and the large numbers of chinook and coho, pink would have been very difficult to survey. No pink were observed.

Because the chum seemed to enter in 2 distinct waves, the later fish counted in November were likely fresh fish that had entered during the heavy rains in the latter half of October. Swim crews noted that the fish counted later appeared fresh and many locals had noted chum holding off the river mouth in late September and early October. This evidence suggests that the peak counts could be misleading as the 2 peak counts between high water periods were not the same fish. Also of note is fish spawned below marker 0 in a portion of the river that is tidally influenced. | neutral | 0.9259699583053589

Somass system data reviewed between February and May 2006. DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till unable to provide updated coho escapement and removal number for Stamp Falls Fishway so "Presence" has been entered as the escapement estimate for both adults and jacks. Stamp Falls Fishway - continuous count, from 1998-09-02 to 1998-11-10. Comment on original 1998 BC16 for the Somass System. Escapement Estimations: Total adult count excludes hatchery removals. Jack counts include hatchery includes hatchery removals. Sockeye escapement: Great Central Lake (GCL) and Sproat fishway counts May 21 - Oct. 19. Total count by electronic counters at Great Central Lake (GCL) and Sproat fishway. Though to be very accurate but manual observations and bio-sampling resulted in 106,000 - 203,000 jacks respectively. These were averaged then deducted from the total return to give the adult spawners. Coho escapement: Counts from Stamp Falls fishway from Sept. 2 to Nov. 10 (adjusted) and Taylor River snorkel swims. Pink escapement: Most spawning takes place from below Stamp Falls and these were not enumerated in 1998 due to poor flying conditions at optimum period. Chum escapement: Most spawning takes place from below Stamp Falls and these were not enumerated in 1998 due to poor flying conditions at optimum period. Chinook escapement: Chinook: Observations by experienced crews on Stamp River did not support the chinook escapement levels observed migrating through Stamp Falls. Applying pre-spawn mortality rates observed in Robertson Creek hatchery resulted in a range of 8,327 - 11,466 female successfully spawned in the Stamp River. Only the optimum spawning beds were used by chinook. Density in these areas were though to be ideal. Estimated 4,000 pre-spawn morts below Stamp Falls included in estimate.

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated chinook escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 1994-06-02 to 1994-09-30. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. No record of chinook being observed so "None Observed" has been entered as escapement estimate. Comment on original 1994 BC16 for the Somass System. Fishway counts - Information from visual adjusted counts at Stamp Falls, Sept. 1st - Nov. 8th. 977 adult + 2,986 coho counted. Does not include spawners in tribs below Stamp Falls.

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated chinook escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 1990-06-12 to 1990-10-19. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. No record of chinook being observed so "None Observed" has been entered as escapement estimate. Comment on original 1990 BC16 for the Stamp River (unable to find a 1990 BC16 for the Somass System). Electronic counters operated by LGL contracting from Sept. 11th to Nov. 8th, 1990. Extreme low water flows. High water temperatures during sockeye migration. Four storm flood events Nov. - Dec. Sockeye spawning hampered by unusual low water flow levels. High pre-spawning mortality. Sockeye extremely stresses from sea lice infestation (Document by PBS Staff). Report prepared by: Jim Robson. Comment on original 1990 BC16 for the Taylor River. Inspection November 6th, coho noted as being observed during spot checks and the estimates for sockeye and coho are listed as unknown. Salmon distribution: Light sockeye use in lower reaches , coho up to highway bridge. Sockeye counted by counter at Sproat River fishway. 40 fish counted during spot checks indicates lots of coho in the stream. Report prepared by Jim Robson. | na | nan

Comment on original 1991 BC16 for the Somass System. Surveyed by electronic counters and helicopter surveys listed for Sept. 17th, October 10th, and November 1st. Spawning distribution: very few chinook spawned below Stamp Falls this year. Evidence of digging up eggs by later spawning fish, very likely with chinook with nearly 100,000 spawning in upper river. Sockeye enhanced in GCL through fertilization - an introduced stock. Hatchery enhancement on coho and chinook. Coho counts do not include tributaries below Stamp Falls, this means no counts for the entire Sproat System, Kitsucksis, Rogers Creek, Cheery Creek, Deer Creek, Beaver Creek, etc. BC16 Report prepared by B Rushton. | na | nan

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated chum escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 1995-06-05 to 1995-09-04. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. No record of chum being observed so "None Observed" has been entered as escapement estimate. Comment on original 1995 BC16 for the Somass System. Observations of system are fishway counts conducted at Great Central Lake, Stamp Falls, and Sproat River. Sockeye counts from electronic counters on Sproat River (June - October,) and Great Central Lake (June - September. Sockeye, chinook, coho, steelhead counts from Stamp Falls fishway observations (September - November) fishway daily counts available from Stock Assessment Division. Inspections inn lower river not conducted; therefore chum, pink, coho, chinook in this area not observed and not encluded in estimates.

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated chum escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Stamp Falls Fishway - continuous count, from 1989-09-14 to 1989-11-19. No chums were recorded going through the Stamp Falls fishway. It is unknown if chums were observed or if present whether they would be enumerated so "Not Inspected" has been entered as the escapement estimate. Chum estimate for the Somass System = Somass River + Kitsucksus Creek + Cherry Creek + Sproat River + Stamp River, Lower + Stamp River, Upper + Beaver Creek + Deer Creek. A small portion of chum make it through Stamp Falls Fishway, the majority of chum spawn in the Somass Mainstem or Lower Sproat River, a few spawn in the Lower Stamp River. Comment on original 1989 BC16 for the Somass System. Monitored regularly by electronic fish counters, video cameras and fishways by division bio staff Sept. 14th to Nov. 15th. Sockeye enhanced by lake fertilization program (PBS) and chinook, coho, and steelhead enhanced by Robertson Creek Hatchery. Salmon distribution: Mostly chums spawn in lower reaches. Chinook, coho, etc. in other tribs (i.e. Sproat, Stamp systems) See Sproat and Stamp reports. Predation: poaching. Unable to read the name of the person who prepared the report. Comment on original 1989 BC16 for McBride Creek. Inspection October 30th, sockeye and coho noted as being observed during a boat survey - estimate listed as unknown. Salmon distribution: Sockeye on North Fork throughout and into lake. No obstructions observed through to upper reaches. Good use of North Branch by sockeye into lake and along east shore of Lake by sockeye. No count made as there is a counter at GCL Dam. No fish seen in South Fork but should be good for coho.

Chum escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 2005-05-12 to 2005-09-29. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. No record of chum being observed so "None Observed" has been entered as escapement estimate. Chum estimate for the Somass System = Somass River + Kitsucksus Creek + Cherry Creek + Sproat River + Stamp River, Lower + Stamp River, Upper + Beaver Creek + Deer Creek. A small portion of chum make it through Stamp Falls Fishway, the majority of chum spawn in the Somass Mainstem or Lower Sproat River, a few spawn in the Lower Stamp River.

Somass system data reviewed February & March 2006. Updated sockeye escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Biologist Diana Dobson. Sockeye estimate for the Somass System = Sproat Lake (the count through Sproat Lake - May to end of Oct.) + Great Central Lake (the count through GCL - May to end of Aug. plus the Stamp Falls Fishway Count - Sept to end of Oct.). Comment on original 1989 BC16 for the Somass System. Monitored regularly by electronic fish counters, video cameras and fishways by division bio staff Sept. 14th to Nov. 15th. Sockeye enhanced by lake fertilization program (PBS) and chinook, coho, and steelhead enhanced by Robertson Creek Hatchery. Salmon distribution: Mostly chums spawn in lower reaches. Chinook, coho, etc. in other tribs (i.e. Sproat, Stamp systems) See Sproat and Stamp reports. Predation: poaching. Unable to read the name of the person who prepared the report. Comment on original 1989 BC16 for McBride Creek. Inspection October 30th, sockeye and coho noted as being observed during a boat survey - estimate listed as unknown. Salmon distribution: Sockeye on North Fork throughout and into lake. No obstructions observed through to upper reaches. Good use of North Branch by sockeye into lake and along east shore of Lake by sockeye. No count made as there is a counter at GCL Dam. No fish seen in South Fork but should be good for coho.

The helicopter survey was excluded from the AUC calculation due to difference in survey methods. Upper and lower river surveys were conducted simultaneously on the same day. Nitinat hatchery staff collected 125 adults and 4 jacks from hatchery swim-ins, 53 adults and 0 jacks from the lake, and 4 adults and 0 jacks from the river of which 114 adults and 0 jacks were used for brood. An additional 30 adults were removed from the river for native food fish. Total removals include 212 adults and 4 jacks. Increased turbidity and clear skies make observations in pools and deeper sections difficult. All surveys were conducted in zero precipitation at the time of survey. Most surveys were conducted when the water level was above normal, but never during flooded conditions. Fish always had access to the Nitinat River; therefore increased rain did not dictate available access. A large amount of erosion is occurring in the lower section of Nitinat from counting station 7-4. Counting station 7 is continuously changing from a large log jam that requires walking around on the gravel bar to being able to swim through. Care should be taken when swimming on this river as it is forever changing.

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated chinook escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 1997-05-27 to 1997-09-26. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. Both adult and jack chinook recored as being observed during snorkel surveys on the Taylor River so "Presence" has been entered as the escapement estimates. Comment on original 1997 BC16 for the Somass System. Sockeye estimate: Great Central Lake (GCL) and Sproat fishway from May 27 to Oct.4. Coho estimate: Stamp Falls fishway from Sept. 2 to Nov. 10. Chum estimate: Most spawning takes place from below Stamp Falls Counts from Stamp Falls fishway (107) and snorkel swims below the fishway (4,252).

Surveys and the final estimates were done by Nitinat Hatchery staff from broodstock collection, test fishing, helicopter flights and swims. No Stream Inspection Logs (SILs) were submitted, only an Escapement Summary From what listed the final escapement estimate and fish removals for coho, chum and chinook. A SIL was generated with the final estimate so SENs could be created. The hatchery estimated 5,000 chinook spawners in the river and the sex ratio was estimated as 60.8% males, 39.2% females and 0% for Jacks. Removals include: 342 adults from the hatchery and 2,490 adults plus 40 jacks from the lake equaling 2,832 adults plus 40 jacks were taken for broodstock; 524 adults plus 5 jacks from the lake were given to natives; 492 adults from the hatchery and 1,547 adults plus 48 jacks from the lake equaling 2,039 adults plus 48 jacks were sold for surplus; and 17 adults from the hatchery and 176 adults plus 1 jack from the lake equaling 193 adults plus 1 jack were moralities.

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated coho escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 1999-05-24 to 1999-09-30. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. Both adult and jack coho recored as being observed in the counter calibration data and during snorkel surveys of the Taylor River so "Presence" has been entered as escapement estimate.

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated chum escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Stamp Falls Fishway - continuous count, from 1995-09-02 to 1995-11-05. No chums were recorded going through the Stamp Falls fishway. It is unknown if chums were observed or if present whether they would be enumerated so "Not Inspected" has been entered as the escapement estimate. Chum estimate for the Somass System = Somass River + Kitsucksus Creek + Cherry Creek + Sproat River + Stamp River, Lower + Stamp River, Upper + Beaver Creek + Deer Creek. A small portion of chum make it through Stamp Falls Fishway, the majority of chum spawn in the Somass Mainstem or Lower Sproat River, a few spawn in the Lower Stamp River. Comment on original 1995 BC16 for the Somass System. Observations of system are fishway counts conducted at Great Central Lake, Stamp Falls, and Sproat River. Sockeye counts from electronic counters on Sproat River (June - October,) and Great Central Lake (June - September. Sockeye, chinook, coho, steelhead counts from Stamp Falls fishway observations (September - November) fishway daily counts available from Stock Assessment Division. Inspections in lower river not conducted; therefore chum, pink, coho, chinook in this area not observed and not encluded in estimates. Coho and steelhead counts are incomplete (they include Stamp Falls unadjusted counts only.) BC16 Report prepared by Bruce Patten. | na | nan

Salmon Distribution or Predator Interactions: Yes Other Comments (May relate to several species): (4) Describe basis for estimating total adults CN Run 1: The estimated number of chinook was arrived at through a combination of netting broodstock and observing the schools of fish while passing them with the boat. Being a lake feed system, it is naturally murky which also adds to the difficulting in assessing. This number of 1,200 was passed on to me from Andrew Jackson a Fishing Gaurdian based at the Kennedy River Hatchery. (7) Enhancements: Removals: approx. 140 females (taken for eggs) and 150 males (all killed prior to removing milt) which produced 750,000 eggs, were taken from the system. Of the 750,000 eggs taken at the Kennedy facility, 450,000 are fertilized and will be reared to 1 G in Tofino Hatchery. Releases for 96 brood year released in 97, approx 720,000 released at hatchery site. (20) On Predator Interactions: Seals, usually 2-3 around, mainly after coho and sockeye. | na | nan

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated chum escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 1985-05-29 to 1985-10-08. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. No record of chum being observed so "None Observed" has been entered as escapement estimate. Comment on original 1985 BC16 for the Somass System. Water levels very low in November. Distribution of spawning salmon: chum in lower river, chinook throughout Sproat and Stamp Rivers, sockeye in lakes, steelhead and coho throughout. Predation normal by wild animals and heavy by man. minor evidence of digging up eggs by later spawning chinook. Obstructions: passable by fishways, falls on Sproat and Stamp River, control dam on Stamp River. In addition to a 5 page supplemental report attached to the BC16, there the following comment not captured on the BC16: Again in 1985 no estimates of spawners utilizing tributary streams in the Somass watershed were carried out due to insufficient manpower .... list of tributaries .... lack of inspections due primarily to 1/3 reduction in Fishery Officer staff in Area 23 and extended duties associated with Area 22 chum fishery.

In 2016, the peak count of 13 Sockeye was made on October 11, but it is likely that these fish were present earlier but missed due to their low abundance and the fact there was a large number of Chinook in the river, which made identification of less abundant species difficult.

Somass system data reviewed March & April 2006. Updated chum escapement numbers for the Somass System provided by DFO Stock Assessment Technician Jeff Till. Sproat sockeye counters - continuous count from 1994-06-02 to 1994-09-30. The Sproat Lake counters are designed for counting sockeye only. The counters count everything that passes through the tunnels and there is a visual count for two hours, twice a week to calibrate the counts. During the visual counts, the absolute number of fish and species composition are recorded then compared with the counter count. The information collected is then used to calibrate the counter data between the visual counts. Calibrations and biosampling (bypass data) is the only time in which other species besides sockeye is observed. As the survey year progresses the calibrations decrease and it is quite feasible to have one (2 hour) calibration done in the month of September when the coho, chum and chinook are travelling through, during this time a greater effort is placed on the Stamp Falls Fishway. This makes it difficult to come up with an escapement estimate for coho, chum and chinook. If the salmon species was observed and recorded in the bypass data, counter calibration data or snorkel survey in the Taylor River then a presence will be entered as the escapement estimate. No record of chum being observed so "None Observed" has been entered as escapement estimate. Comment on original 1994 BC16 for the Somass System. Fishway counts - Information from visual adjusted counts at Stamp Falls, Sept. 1st - Nov. 8th. 977 adult + 2,986 coho counted. Does not include spawners in tribs below Stamp Falls.

The snorkel surveys on September 22, 30, and the Oct 10th (drone) and September 25th(Bank walk) surveys are not included because of minimal coverage of the survey area/a difference in methods. September 10 used for first zero as Conuma River hydromet used as a proxy for Canton creek water levels.Possibly missed peak, or surveyed at peak. Historically it has been documented that Coho do not enter the Canton system until there is sufficient flows to allow movement past shallow marker 1 Coho are known to migrate above the 3500m surveyed section. Low flows restrict Coho to pools/runs below Marker 3. Coho move as far as Marker 5 with high flows, although it is unclear how many move beyond this point as it occurs later once surveys have finished. 35d survey life used based on historical information. Coho Spawning habitat is limited upstream of Marker 7, crews believe that it is likely that Coho remain below this point to eventually spawn. AUC used. | na | nan
